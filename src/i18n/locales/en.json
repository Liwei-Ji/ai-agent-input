  "consent_desc_1":"Actively obtaining user consent before sharing data with AI helps build trust, provides accountability, and supports an ethically responsible user experience.",
  "consent_desc_2":"Default settings should follow an opt-in rather than opt-out approach, as silence does not equal consent.

This transforms AI from a mere transactional tool into a reliable long-term assistant.",
  "memory_desc_2":"Newly stored memories should be clearly presented to users, along with simple management options that allow them to control which memories are retained.

  "Signal expectation gaps or errors in the model – but is that clear to the user?": "Signal expectation gaps or errors in the model – but is that clear to the user?",
  "rating_desc_1":"Users should clearly know when they are interacting with an AI model. Through likes or click based feedback, users can inform engineers whether the model’s behavior meets expectations a practice that is especially important for proprietary models or safety focused models handling sensitive data.",
  "rating_desc_2":"In practice, such feedback is often presented using thumbs-up icons or star ratings. Ideally or at least preferably systems should provide more information about what happens after a user submits feedback, transparently indicating whether the evaluation applies to a single response or reflects the overall performance of the model.",

  "Data ownership": "Data ownership",
  "Control how the model remembers and uses your data": "Control how the model remembers and uses your data",
  "data_ownership_desc_1":"The use of personal data online has always been contentious. When people interact with AI or engage in collaborative creation, the boundaries between user data, platform data, and intermediary information often become blurred.",
  "data_ownership_desc_2":"Interfaces should provide transparent and controllable settings, allowing users to clearly understand which features they have enabled or disabled and how their information is being used.",

  "color_desc_2":"Visually represent both what data the AI used and where the content originated. Drawing inspiration from how humans use highlighters to mark key points, highlight the core ideas that are being referenced, and clearly list the corresponding references or search results beneath the text, enabling users to click through and verify the information.",

  "Disclosure": "Disclosure",
  "Clearly mark content and interactions guided or delivered by AI": "Clearly mark content and interactions guided or delivered by AI",
  "disclosure_desc_1": "One key way to enhance users’ sense of safety is to remain transparent and explicit throughout their interactions with artificial intelligence.",
  "disclosure_desc_2":  "At the core of disclosure is transparency: when the AI proactively performs actions such as classification, labeling, or archiving, it must clearly indicate that these actions are carried out by the AI, while reserving final decision-making authority for the user.",

  "Name": "Name",
  "How do we refer to the AI?": "How do we refer to the AI?",
  "name_desc_1":"Users have the right to know what or whom they are interacting with.",
  "name_desc_2":"Naming helps set expectations by signaling whether the AI is a tool, a collaborator, or something in between. It also enables customization names can be defined by the company, chosen by the user, or adapted to specific contexts. Through naming, artificial intelligence becomes less of an abstract system and more of a recognizable part of the user’s world.",

  "Personality": "Personality",
  "Characteristics that distinguish the AI's personality and vibe": "Characteristics that distinguish the AI's personality and vibe",
  "personality_desc_1":"A friendly and enthusiastic personality helps create a sense of comfort and encourages users to explore more features; in contrast, a concise and rational personality emphasizes stability and efficiency.",
  "personality_desc_2":"A well-designed personality framework allows a product to share the same core model across diverse contexts, while switching between friendly, professional, or mechanical expression styles simply by adjusting tone, level of formality, and interaction behaviors."
