  "follow_up.desc_1": "In an ideal scenario, the user is so good at prompting that they can reach a great outcome on their first try. In reality, that's often not the case. Follow ups are prompts, questions, or inline actions that help users refine or extend their initial interaction with the model so the model can better understand their intent.",
  "follow_up.desc_2": "A well-timed follow up saves compute cycles, prevents wasted effort, and communicates that the AI is working alongside the user rather than starting over.",

  "initial_cta.desc_1": "For many products, the first touchpoint with AI is through the Initial CTA: A prominent collection of inputs and actions that allow a user to start prompting. From here, the user works with the model through regenerations, variants, and other actions in order to reach their intended goal.",
  "initial_cta.desc_2": "The most common implementation of this pattern is a large direct input box, where the system goal is to understand the user’s context and intent as quickly as possible while minimizing the amount of work they have to do to express it. The implementation of this pattern varies depending on the context and capabilities of the surrounding application.",
